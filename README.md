 Hi, I’m @whitetail-enthusiast, or Buck :3!!!
I’m interested in lots of things!! i play a lot of videogames, especially survival-based ones and ones with room for or a focus on being creative. I also really like deer!!!!! especially whitetails, hence the name. They're SUPER cool and SUPER fun to research. my favorite book genre is anti-westerns, my favorite color is tornado-sky green, and i love love love seafood and raspberries!!
I’m learning c# but I haven't gotten very far and am essentially illiterate when it comes to actually using it.
You can reach me at my gmail, rottentailrun@gmail.com :333!!
I use he/him and xe/xem for the most part, but pretty much anything aside from she/her and they/them is okay.
